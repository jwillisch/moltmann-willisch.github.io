# About Me

## Anne-Ruth Moltmann-Willisch, LL.M.
*Former Regional Court Judge, Mediator*

As an experienced jurist and mediator, I combine many years of experience in the court system with modern approaches to conflict resolution. My journey from judge to mediator reflects the evolution of how conflicts can be resolved more effectively and sustainably today.

## My Philosophy

> *"As a judge, my role was to decide conflicts. As a mediator, I work together with the parties to achieve resolution of their conflict through better understanding of their conflicting interests."*

This experience from both worlds - decisive jurisprudence and mediating mediation - enables me to view conflicts from different perspectives and develop the most appropriate solution strategy for each situation.

### Why Mediation?

Modern jurisprudence has recognized that not every conflict is optimally resolved through a judicial decision. Mediation offers the opportunity to:

- **Develop self-determined solutions** that all parties can support
- **Preserve relationships** instead of burdening them through court proceedings
- **Save time and costs** through efficient conflict resolution
- **Create sustainable agreements** that have long-term validity

## My Approach

### Professional Competence
My legal background provides deep understanding of legal frameworks, rights, and obligations that often underlie conflicts. This expertise helps parties understand their positions while exploring creative solutions.

### Neutral Facilitation
Drawing from years of judicial experience in maintaining neutrality, I create a safe space where all parties can express their perspectives and interests openly.
