# Services

## Professional Mediation and Conflict Resolution

As an experienced mediator and former Regional Court Judge, I offer comprehensive services for resolving conflicts efficiently and sustainably outside of court.

---

## Core Services

### 🤝 **Mediation**
*Structured process for voluntary conflict resolution*

Mediation is a confidential process where I, as a neutral third party, help conflicting parties find their own solutions. Unlike court proceedings, mediation preserves relationships and enables creative solutions.

**Areas of Application:**
- Business and partnership disputes
- Contract and warranty conflicts  
- Workplace and team conflicts
- Neighbor disputes

### ⚖️ **Arbitration** 
*Binding dispute resolution outside court*

In arbitration, I make binding decisions based on legal or agreed-upon criteria. This process is faster and more cost-effective than court proceedings while providing legal certainty.

**Suitable for:**
- Commercial disputes
- Construction law conflicts
- Contract interpretation disputes
- Damage claims

### 🎯 **Consultation**
*Legal advice and conflict analysis*

Sometimes a professional assessment of the situation is sufficient to find a path forward. I offer comprehensive consultation on conflict resolution strategies and legal options.

**Services include:**
- Conflict analysis and assessment
- Strategy development for negotiations
- Legal risk evaluation
- Preparation for mediation or court proceedings
